<i>flat; small attic window at</i> <small>C</small>., <i>shewing the slanting roof of a
house beyond, with two large chimney pots, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="description"><i>At the rising of the curtain,</i> P<small>HŒBE</small> <i>is
discovered on chair,</i> <small>R</small>.,<i> taking down linen, which is hanging up on a
line, and depositing it in a clothes basket at her side.</i></p>

<p class="i0">P<small>HŒBE</small>. (<i>singing</i>) I’m off to Charlestown early in the

<p class="entrance"><i>The small door,</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.,
<i>opens, and</i> J<small>ONATHAN</small> <i>appears—he has a house broom in one
hand.</i></p>

<p>J<small>ONATHAN</small>. Ah! there’s my pretty, merry-hearted little bird, chirruping
away as usual.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. Yes, uncle Jonathan, and now that you <i>are</i> here, you’ll
help your “little bird” to take down her clothes line, won’t you? (<i>gets down</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. Very well; only we must look sharp about it; our drawing rooms
and second floor give a party to-night. Dear, dear! only to think of the swaps and changes
of this mortal life! I recollect our drawing rooms and second floor, Mr. Bunny, going
about the streets of London, crying, “Hare skins—rabbit skins!”</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. And now he’s a retired furrier, with no end of money! I only wish
I was rich!</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. Phœbe, allow me to remind you, that when your parents sent you
up from Cambridge—celebrated for its university and its sausages—it was in order to cure
you of your nonsensical notions of finery and grandeur. (<i>on</i> <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. No such thing!</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. No such thing! when you were actually trying to entrap the
affections of a young man, considerably higher up the social ladder than yourself!</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. What, Triptolemus Brown! he was only assistant to a chemist and
druggist, after all. Poor dear Trip, many’s the cake of soap and box of hair pins he’s
given me. Mark my words, uncle Jonathan, I know he’ll come up to London and find me
out—I’m sure of it, and then——</p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. (<i>without</i>) Jonathan!</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. (<i>paying no attention</i>) And then—only let me catch him
coming after you, and if I don’t give him one for his nob—— (<i>flourishing his
broom</i>)</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>The little door,</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.,
<i>opens, and as</i> B<small>UNNY</small> <i>enters,</i>
J<small>ONATHAN</small>’<small>S</small> <i>broom falls on his hat, and bonnets
him.</i></p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. (<i>shouting</i>) Help! murder!</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. (<i>raising up</i> B<small>UNNY</small>’<small>S</small>
<i>hat</i>) Mr. Bunny!</p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. Jonathan! How is it, sir, that I find myself obliged to scramble
up in the dark to the top of my own house—to the very attics, after my own servant? and
when I find my own servant, my own servant breaks my own broom handle over my own
head?</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. It’s my fault, Mr. Bunny; I asked uncle, as a particular favour,
to come up here.</p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. But I presume you didn’t ask uncle, as a particular favour, to
demolish my new hat! (<i>shewing his hat smashed</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. Oh! if that’s all, I can pay for it; about five and ninepence, I
suppose. (<i>putting his hand into his breeches pocket</i>)</p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. Jonathan, my ball opens at eight o’clock—it is now half-past six.
Is it your intention, sir, to illuminate my drawing rooms, by lighting the gas, or must I
perform that office myself.</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. I’m going, sir.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. Oh, Mr. Bunny, if you would only let me have a peep at the fine
ladies and gentlemen; besides, I might, perhaps, make myself useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. Very true! I will therefore entrust you, Miss Phœbe, with the
custody of the negus.</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Negus! a pint of South African Port to a gallon
of water.</p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. You, Jonathan, will respond to the double-knocks, and announce
the respective guests as they enter the drawing room—thus, (<i>announcing</i>) Mr. and
Mrs. So-and-so; rather slow and very plain.</p>

<p>J<small>ONATH</small>. (<i>imitating</i>) “Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so; rather slow and very
plain.” All right, sir. (<i>going</i>)</p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. Stop; precede me with your lantern. (J<small>ONATHAN</small>
<i>goes rapidly out at door,</i> <small>C</small>., <i>and disappears</i>) Holloa, stop
for me, sir! (<i>about to go out through door—turns to</i> P<small>HŒBE</small>)
Remember, Miss Phœbe, I depend on you. (<i>he goes out, and immediately a noise is heard
as of a person falling down stairs</i>)</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. Ha, ha, ha! uncle little suspects that I’ve written to my dear
Triptolemus at Cambridge! but I wasn’t so imprudent as to tell him where I lived—no, no, I
only sent him the address of our establishment in Cranbourne Alley, and——</p>

<p>V<small>OICE</small>. (<i>outside</i>) Phœbe, Phœbe!</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. That’s our third floor’s voice. Is that you, Miss Arabella? Come
in.</p>

<p class="entrance">A<small>RABELLA</small> H<small>ARDAPORT</small> <i>enters at
door,</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.</p>

<p>A<small>RABELLA</small>. I’ve got three orders for the theatre to-night, will you come?
My cousin, Mr. Luke Sharp, has volunteered to escort us.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Another cousin! that makes the thirty-seventh that
<i>I</i> know of. (<i>aloud</i>) Much obliged, but I’m engaged—I’m going to Mr. Bunny’s
ball.</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. Well, if you won’t come with us, I’ll say good-bye—Oh, stop! do
step down a minute, there’s a good girl, and tell me if my new pork pie suits me.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. Pork pie?</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. Yes—my hat; it’s a present from Cousin Benjamin.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Thirty-eight!</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. Do oblige me, there’s a dear. And, Phœbe——</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. Well!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>RIPT</small>. Wheugh! I’ve done it! I don’t know how, but done it I have. Talk
of exploring the interior of Africa! pooh! that’s a joke to the inside of a chimney!
(<i>wiping his face with his handkerchief—shaking his coat, &amp;c.</i>) Well, if
this is the hospitality that the Metropolis offers to a youthful and inoffensive chemist
and druggist, I shan’t avail myself of it again in a hurry. I left Cambridge for London
this morning, in consequence of a telegraphic message I received from my uncle, Cockletop,
grocer and cheesemonger—to catch the train, I lost my breakfast; the only available
refreshment was a cigar and box of lozenges; under the influence of these exhilirating
sweetmeats, I soon found myself at the abode of my aforesaid uncle Cockletop, who, on my
taking a chair on a Cheshire cheese, at once informed me that his motive in telegraphing
for me, was to unite me in the bonds of wedlock with a certain Miss Caroline Bunny; his
words literally transfixed me to my chair—my cheese I mean. I was about to tell him that
the object of my unalterable affection was Phœbe Furbelow, when he cut me short by
directing me to betake myself and carpet bag to No. 17, Compton-street, Soho—there it is—
(<i>pointing out of the window</i>) where he had secured me a small but airy back room,
immediately under the tiles; telling me to make myself as smart as possible, in order that
he might take me with him to a ball, which, it seems, the father of my <i>intended
intended</i> is to give this evening. I promised implicit obedience, and proved it, by
starting off in the opposite direction for Cranbourne-alley, where Phœbe <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span>told me she pursued the
art of bonnet-making. I found the shop, and was endeavouring to catch a glimpse of her
beloved profile, when I suddenly received a terrific blow—from a foot—behind—which almost
sent me head-first through the shop window. I turned round and found myself face to face
with a ferocious looking individual, almost as tall as the lamp-post, and considerably
stouter. (<i>mechanically wiping his face with the linen he takes out of the clothes
basket, and blackening it</i>) Well, my first impulse was to come Tom Sayers over him, but
it suddenly occurred to me that the brawny ruffian before me might be a husband and a
father, I therefore spared him, and walked slowly away—as fast as my legs could carry me!
but he overtook me at the door of my lodgings. How I got up three flights of stairs, I
don’t know; but I’d no sooner precipitated myself into my attic, and bolted the door, then
a voice demanded instant admission. Instinctively I seized the poker, the poker reminded
me of the fireplace, the fireplace of the chimney—away I flew—up the flue, and I was
saved! (<i>wiping his face again with the clean linen, and blackening it</i>) I wonder if
the bulky miscreant is still there? (<i>looking out at window</i>) I do declare he’s
actually lighted the fire! I see the smoke coming out of the chimney! Ecod! then I’m well
out of it! Goodness gracious! (<i>wipes his face with the clean linen</i>) what can I have
done to this sanguinary vampire? The only thing I can think of, is that he may have been
poorly at Cambridge, and that I may have sent him pills that made him poorlier!</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. (<i>without</i>) Now, uncle, I never can carry down that large
basket of clothes by myself—do come and help me! (<i>comes in at little door,</i>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. That voice!</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. (<i>stumbling over the linen which</i> T<small>RIPTOLEMUS</small>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. Hush! don’t make a noise! Phœbe, don’t you know me? I’m
Triptolemus—your own Triptolemus, just arrived from Cambridge to see you, by the flue—I
mean the train.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. Triptolemus! how did you get here?</p>

address of the nearest magistrate, or show me his chimney pot, that’ll do as well.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. That my life is in jeopardy—that I’m in danger of being torn
to pieces, or swallowed whole—one or the other, perhaps both, if you don’t save me.—Ah, a
door! (<i>about to run to small door,</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.)</p>

to murder you if he catches you here.</p>

population of London since I’ve been in it, and two of them seem bent on my immediate
destruction!</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. I was.</p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. Who?</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. Myself; ’tis a habit I’ve got when I’m alone and want a little
conversation.</p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. Umph! it sounded to <i>me</i> like a man’s voice. (<i>with
intention, and looking intently at her</i>) Umph! (<i>suspiciously</i>) Now listen to me,
sister Bella. (<i>taking a chair and sitting down</i>) You must know—— (<i>here a noise is
heard in room,</i> <small>R</small>.&nbsp;2&nbsp;<small>E</small>.) What’s that?</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. (<i>striving to conceal her alarm</i>) What?</p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. That noise.</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. Where?</p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. (<i>looking suspiciously at</i> A<small>RABELLA</small>, <i>and
then pointing to room,</i> <small>R</small>.&nbsp;2&nbsp;<small>E</small>.) There.</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. (<i>quickly</i>) Oh! it’s only Mrs. Sheepshanks, the charwoman,
putting my room to rights; she always comes on Mondays.</p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. This is <i>Friday!</i></p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. Mondays and Fridays. (<i>aside</i>) I’m more dead than
alive!</p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. Well, as I was going to say—about two months ago I put into
Plymouth with my first cargo of herrings, and there I got into company with an old
gentleman with a bald head, green spectacles, and an only daughter—the smartest-looking
craft I ever clapped eyes on! Well, finding I couldn’t forget her, I determined to follow
her to London, got here this morning, called on the old gentleman, made an offer of my
hand and my herrings, when, muskets and marlinspikes, what d’ye think he told me? That the
young woman I was sweet upon was already engaged to be spliced to some loblolly lubber or
other at Cambridge, that she’d never even clapped her precious eyes on!</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. Rather unfortunate, I must confess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. Yes, especially as, in my opinion, it’s all owing to <i>you</i>
that I’ve been cut adrift!</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. To <i>me?</i></p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. Yes, they must have found out that I, Captain Bellerophon
Hardaport, had got a sister in the fancy chip and straw bonnet line, who isn’t
<i>quite</i> so particular as to the number of her admirers as she might be.</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. That’s my business.</p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. Never mind; now I <i>am</i> here, I’ll soon clear the decks of
the whole crew of ’em. I began with an impertinent young jackanapes just now, that I found
squinting at you through your shop window, in Cranbourne-alley. I haven’t done with that
fellow yet; I know the cut of his jib, and if I ever do come alongside of him again, if I
don’t blow him clean out of the water, at the first broadside, my name ain’t
Hardaport.</p>

<p>A<small>RABEL</small>. You may blow him wherever you may think proper. I know nothing
of the young man.</p>

<p>C<small>APT</small>. H. (<i>satirically</i>) Of course not! (<i>here a loud noise as of
furniture falling and smashing of glass heard from room,</i>
<small>R</small>.&nbsp;2&nbsp;<small>E</small>.—<i>looking at</i> A<small>RABELLA</small>,

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. Nonsense! Find him you must! (<i>here</i> P<small>HŒBE</small>
<i>re-enters at little front door,</i> <small>L</small>.) or else the marriage of Caroline
Bunny, spinster, and Triptolemus Brown, bachelor, cannot take place!</p>

<p>C<small>OCKLE</small>. (<i>suddenly, and looking of at</i> <small>C</small>.
<i>towards</i> <small>L</small>.) Ah! I think I see him in the ball room—look
there—dancing the polka! Here, young woman. (<i>giving hat and paletot to</i>
P<small>HŒBE</small>—P<small>HŒBE</small> <i>goes into small room,</i> <small>L</small>.
<i>with things</i>)</p>

<p>C<small>OCKLE</small>. Come along, Bunny, come along! (<i>puts his arm within</i>
B<small>UNNY</small>’<small>S</small> <i>and drags him off,</i> <small>C</small>.

<p class="entrance"><i>Here one of the window curtains is drawn aside, and</i>
T<small>RIPTOLEMUS</small> <i>peeps in.</i></p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. The coast seems clear! (<i>looks cautiously round, and then
comes forward—he has his pocket handkerchief tied round his head, his coat still
ripped up to the collar, looks quite wet through, and the picture of wretchedness</i>) I
shan’t forget my visit to the metropolis of civilized England in a hurry. (<i>seeing the
sideboard</i>) What’s that? something in the refreshment line! I’m not addicted to picking
and stealing, but a man can’t be expected to go all day long, on half an ounce of
lozenges! (<i>goes to the sideboard and begins helping himself, drinking the negus out of
the decanters</i>)</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. (<i>seeing</i> T<small>RIPTOLEMUS</small>) Ah! somebody helping
himself to the negus! Holloa, sir!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. (<i>turning round, his mouth stuffed full of cakes and each
hand crammed with them—seeing</i> P<small>HŒBE</small>) What’s the matter? Ah,
Phœbe!</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. Trip! Dear—dear, how wet you look!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. Do you expect a man to stand under a waterspout and not get
wet? Look there. (<i>squeezing a quantity of water out of his coat tail</i>)</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. I don’t wish to alarm you, but that dreadful captain, who threw
you out of the window——</p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. Well?</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. He’s here!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. (<i>jumping round frightened</i>) Where?</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. There, in the ball room. Just now I heard him grinding his teeth,
and muttering to himself, “This ball is given in honour of him, is it? then he shall have
balls enough, for I’ll give him a brace through his body.” So make your escape at
once.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. How? no more chimneys—no more windows! I should prefer a
staircase this time, just for the novelty of the thing.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. You’ll find one there. (<i>pointing to one of the small doors
at</i> <small>L</small>.) Make haste!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. Wait a minute. (<i>runs to the sideboard, and takes a decanter
in one hand, and a plate of cakes in the other</i>)</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. (<i>looking off at</i> <small>C</small>.) Here’s some one coming.

this</i>)</p>

he promised to send hasn’t made his appearance yet.</p>

<p>P<small>HŒBE</small>. Yes, sir. (<i>aside</i>) And at the same time, I’ll see poor dear
Triptolemus safe off the premises!</p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. Ah! here’s Cockletop again! (<i>seeing</i>
C<small>OCKLETOP</small>, <i>who comes in at</i> <small>C</small>. <i>from</i>

<p>C<small>OCKLE</small>. (<i>still very red in the face, and making another ineffectual

lodgings again—had another fire lighted, and another bottle of Sherry—no news. Suppose we
say the poor boy is ill in bed?</p>

<p>B<small>UNNY</small>. (<small>L</small>.) Better say he’s dead!—that’ll settle the

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. I don’t know whose garment this is that I’ve got into, but
from the extensive assortment of gloves in the pockets, I should say he must be a hosier

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. (<i>faintly, and wiping his face with a handful of gloves,

lately.</p>

out for a young chap here—a rival! (<i>in a voice of
thunder</i>—T<small>RIPTOLEMUS</small> <i>gives a violent start</i>) whose brains, if he’s
got any, I mean to blow out—all fair and above board, of course! Now, what d’ye think I’d

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. Don’t you think “Beat my neighbour out of doors,” rather a

<p>C<small>OCKLE</small>. No, no; perhaps you won’t object to say cribbage?</p>

<p>T<small>RIPTOLE</small>. Certainly not, sir, if it will gratify you. Cribbage—I’ll say
it again—cribbage!</p>

Twenty-five.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
